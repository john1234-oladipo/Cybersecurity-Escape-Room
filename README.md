![Audience](https://img.shields.io/badge/audience-all%20ages-green)

An interactive cybersecurity-themed escape room that can be run virtually (web-based) or physically with props. Participants solve cybersecurity puzzles to "escape" while learning important security concepts.

## Virtual Version

### Features
- 4 cybersecurity-themed puzzles
- 30-minute timer
- Responsive design works on desktop and mobile
- No server required (runs entirely in browser)

### Setup
1. Download all files
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. No installation or internet required after downloading

### Puzzles Included
1. **Phishing Email**: Identify suspicious elements in a fake email
2. **Encryption Challenge**: Decrypt a secret message
3. **Network Intrusion**: Analyze network traffic to find vulnerabilities
4. **Social Engineering**: Spot information disclosure risks

## Physical Version

### Materials Needed
- Printed puzzle materials
- Locks (combination, key, etc.)
- Boxes or containers
- Tablets/computers (optional for digital components)
- Timer

### Setup Instructions

#### Station 1: Phishing Email
- Print the fake email and place in a sealed envelope
- Attach to a locked box containing the next clue
- Solution: The word "invoice" (from the fake invoice number)

#### Station 2: Encryption Challenge
- Create a Caesar cipher wheel or printed cipher
- Provide an encrypted message: "fdhvdu" (shift of 3, solution: "caesar")
- Include a hint about shifting letters

#### Station 3: Network Intrusion
- Print a fake network diagram with vulnerabilities
- Highlight an open SSH port (22)
- Solution is "port22"

#### Station 4: Social Engineering
- Create fake social media profiles sharing too much info
- Question should ask for "mother's maiden name"
- Solution is "mothersmaiden"

### Flow
1. Participants start with the phishing email
2. Each solved puzzle reveals a code to open the next station
3. Final puzzle provides the "escape" code

### Facilitation Tips
- Have a cheat sheet with solutions
- Provide hints if teams are stuck
- Debrief after to explain the cybersecurity lessons
- Adjust difficulty based on audience

## Learning Objectives
- Recognize phishing attempts
- Understand basic encryption
- Identify network vulnerabilities
- Spot social engineering risks

## Customization
- Add more puzzles for longer sessions
- Adjust difficulty for different age groups
- Incorporate physical challenges (like wiring networks)
- Add digital elements with QR codes
